          <h2>What oneAPS is</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-profession/join-digital-profession" target="_blank">Digital Profession</a>, our Digital Profession team are trialing a whole-of-government program called oneAPS Opportunities (working title). This program aims to assist agencies to come together to work on government priorities and uplift digital capabilities through digital talent mobility.
          </p>
          <h2>What the program does</h2>
          <p>
            oneAPS Opportunities gives managers access to digital professions from across the APS. This will assist with short-term flexible work placements, called opportunities, while staying linked to their home teams/agencies. These forms of placements are supported in the APS Mobility Framework called "<a href="https://www.apsc.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/aps-mobility-framework/mobility-fundamentals#types-of-arrangements-for-temporary-moves-between-organisations-">Informal arrangements</a>".
          </p>
          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <p>
            An opportunity is like a ‘<b>micro-assignment</b>’ where APS staff can work on a task, in a role, or on a project for a short period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many ways to approach this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Employees often move locations as part of these arrangements, but it’s also possible for moves to be virtual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The supervisor and employee will agree on what works best for them.
          </p>
