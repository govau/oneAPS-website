As part of the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-profession" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Digital Profession</a>, the DTA are trialing a new approach to uplift skills through digital talent mobility. 

oneAPS Opportunities enables managers to access digital professionals from across the Federal Government to assist with short-term flexible work opportunities.

The program is inspired by gig economy platforms such as Freelancer, Airtasker and <a href="https://openopps.usajobs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">US Government Open Opportunities</a>.

Staff stay linked to their home teams using ‘Informal arrangements’. Staff retains pay and conditions in line with the home organisation’s enterprise agreement and remains on their home organisation’s payroll.

For further guidance on mobility for managers, employees, HR and executive, see the <a href="https://www.apsc.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/aps-mobility-framework/mobility-fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">APS Mobility Framework</a> by the APSC.
