Under an informal mobility arrangement, staff members can work elsewhere on government priorities for a few days to a few months while remaining on their home organisation’s payroll. 

### Informal arrangements:

- used by agencies who have a close working relationship
- usually a few days to a few months
- employee retains pay and conditions in line with the home organisation’s enterprise agreement and remains on home organisation’s payroll
- ASL remains with the home organisation
- employee can be ‘shared’ between the organisations if desired (e.g. a two-three day split, or ‘week on week off’)
- usually supported by an email or letter

The host manager, home manager and employee will agree on what schedule works best for them to complete the opportunity.
