Browse opportunities on the <a href="/opportunity" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Find opportunities</a> page.

When you select 'Apply for opportunity' you will be prompted to register an account. This involves providing your contact details and validating your government email address.

Once you’re logged in, the application is short and easy. It includes: 

- A short pitch about why you’re interested in the opportunity and what you have to offer. 
- Options to link to a public profile such as LinkedIn or upload a current resume.

When you complete your application, your account contact details will be shared with the opportunity manager.

While these opportunities are not as exhaustive as some full-time role applications, writing a good pitch will increase your chances of being selected.

## <span id="Writing-a-personal-pitch">Writing a personal pitch</span> 

Your pitch is a chance to tell the agency why you are the right person for the opportunity. It should clearly say who you are, what you have to offer and what you’d like to gain from doing this opportunity.

**Getting started:**

### 1. Who you are 

Open with a little bit about yourself such as your current role, special skills and experience, or a brief overview of current responsibilities.

### 2. What you offer to this opportunity

Show the value you want to bring to this opportunity. Talk about how your skills, experience and attributes are relevant for the opportunity.

**Tip:** Make a list of all things you’re awesome at, the things people love you for, and the things you are proud of. Once you have all your awesomeness down in one place, pick out the pieces that feel the most relevant to the opportunity you are applying for.

If you are less experienced in the digital skill asked for, talk about your interest and enthusiasm, relevant training you have done and how you are currently working on building this skill.

### 3. Why you are interested in this opportunity 

Let them know why you want to work on this opportunity. Some ideas to include are:

- Your motivation
- Desire to get experience working at this agency
- Wish to be involved in coaching/mentoring
- Desire to work with different people with different skills 
- Your interest in the specific topic 
- Wish to develop skills
- Desire to contribute to the oneAPS vision
- Need a temporary change (it’s as good as a holiday!)

## <span id="An-example-of-a-pitch">An example of a pitch</span> 

*I am currently a Service Designer working in the Design Lab at the Department of Health. I most recently completed a discovery project with aged citizens to identify barriers to care in their homes. As a senior designer in the Design Lab I led the synthesis and service mapping component of this project, identifying opportunities to develop and test further.*

*My strengths are looking at the big picture (systems thinking) and looking at all the touchpoints and connections (or dis-connections). My experience of over 10 years in service design and developing service blueprints on a variety of complex health and welfare problems will most certainly be of value working on this opportunity.*

*I would really like the opportunity to do some meaningful work at the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. I have a work history in secondary education and having children myself I am very interested in the subject of preparing our future workforce.*

*I am available to chat, look forward to hearing from you.*
