When you post an opportunity, you will be notified of applications received by email. 

To review your applications, log in to oneAPS Opportunities and go to “My profile”. 

Here you will be able to read pitches from applicants as to why they would like to participate in your opportunity and what skills they bring to the opportunity. 

Some applicants may also share a link to a public profile such as LinkedIn or they may have chosen to upload their resume.

## <span name="Get-in-touch-for-a-chat">Get in touch for a chat</span> 

When you like a person’s application, we recommend you get in touch to organise a quick chat to see if they are a good match. 

Be prepared to answer questions about your opportunity and talk about how it could benefit both parties.  

You may want to check here whether the applicant has had approval or not in principle from their manager. 

## <span name="Choosing-your-applicant">Choosing your applicant</span> 

How you notify your successful applicant is up to you. 

Once you do decide, it would be good organise a chat between the host manager, home manager and successful applicant to make sure you are all on the same page. 

See <a href="http://oneaps.gov.au/help-pages/5-onboarding/"_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Onboarding</a> for more information. 

## <span name="Notifying-unsuccessful-applicants">Notifying unsuccessful applicants</span> 

When you have confirmed someone for your opportunity, you will need to let other applicants know via email that they were unsuccessful. 

Your email may look something like: 

*Hi [insert name],*

*Thank you for your applying for our opportunity [insert name of opportunity].*

*Unfortunately, on this occasion your application was not successful but we encourage you to apply for other opportunities in the future.*

*Keep an eye out for more short-term flexible opportunities at oneaps.gov.au*  

*Best wishes,*

*[insert your name]*
