# Offboarding
At this stage you may consider:
* Preparing and completing any handovers needed
* Completing a retrospective session to reflect on the goals you set out to achieve, what worked well, and lessons learnt

As this is a pilot, the DTA Specialist Advice and Mobility Team may wish to interview key people involved to understand their experiences and their feedback on how to improve the program.
