Under an “Informal arrangement”, the host manager, home manager and employee will agree on what schedule works best for them to complete the opportunity:

- used by agencies who have a close working relationship
- usually a few days to a few months
- employee retains pay and conditions in line with the home organisation’s enterprise agreement and remains on home organisation’s payroll
- ASL remains with the home organisation
- employee can be ‘shared’ between the organisations if desired (e.g. a two-three day split, or ‘week on week off’)
- usually supported by an email or letter

For example, an employee may continue their regular duties most days and work every Friday on the oneAPS Opportunity. Or they may work a couple of hours on the oneAPS Opportunity one selected days.](https://github.com/govau/oneAPS-website/blob/master/Calendar.jpg)

As this is a pilot, we will have a few touchpoints along the way to get your feedback and provide support. 

We will also encourage you to share your story when the opportunity is completed.
