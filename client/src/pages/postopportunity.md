We are trialling a new approach to mobility in government. Here's some information to help you decide if this is the right place for you.

# Who can post an opportunity?

Any Commonwealth Government employee can post an opportunity.


# What opportunities can I post? 

We encourage opportunities that are:

:heavy_check_mark: A few hours or days to a few months long

:heavy_check_mark: Seeking digital or data skills (link to our guidance page on digital and data)

:heavy_check_mark: Able to be completed flexibly through remote working or part time hours

:heavy_check_mark: Do not need full onboarding to your organisation’s ICT systems

:heavy_check_mark: Low risk

:heavy_check_mark: Able to be completed through an informal arrangement 

Opportunities that do not fit the program:

:x: Secondments or temporary transfers

:x: Opportunities where there is a change to pay and conditions 

:x: Time sensitive or high-risk opportunities 

:x: Opportunities which contain Sensitive or Classified information


# How it works

An opportunity is kind of like a ‘micro-assignment’ where APS staff can work on a task, in a role, or on a project for a short period of time.

Informal arrangements are usually supported by an email agreement between a host manager, home manager and staff member. 

Under an informal arrangement:

- Staff retain pay and conditions in line with the home organisation’s enterprise agreement 

- Staff remain on home organisation’s payroll

- Staff can work between the organisations (e.g. a two-three day split, or ‘week on week off’)

# Help us shape the future of this initiative
  
As this is a pilot, we will have a few touchpoints along the way to get your feedback and provide support. 

We will also encourage you to share your story when the opportunity is completed.
